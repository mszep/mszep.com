Hi! My name is **Mark Szepieniec**. [^1]

I'm currently doing a PhD in simulation of molecular electronics, but
my interests range from computer science (machine learning and
programming languages) to nanotechnology (directed self-assembly and
semiconductor device modeling) to chemistry (ab-initio electronic
structure theory) to biology (synthetic biology and DIYbio).

You can follow me on [twitter][twitter] or [github][github], or
contact me directly via email (my gmail username is the same as my
twitter username).

Here are some projects I've worked on:

[The Markdown resume][markdown-resume]

:   Allows users to produce high-quality pdf resumes from markdown source.

[Mining New Biomaterials][biomaterials]

:   Proof-of-concept searching a materials database for biomedically useful materials.
